                    Immigrants often face challenges managing and investing the money they have access to. The situation becomes especially challenging when they need money but lack a Social Security Number. Banks, the system does not bridge them to successful onboarding. The system also fosters a sense of community to support internal lending practices, offering an alternative to traditional credit checks based on Social Security Numbers.

                    The past month has brought a vast amount of changes. To begin, the team was introduced to a number of new concepts, and ideas by our teaching team; not only from the NYC design factory but from various external design factories as well. To begin with, we were introduced to Planet Centric Design as a means for us to understand the effect our system has on individual “earthly” resources. The teaching team wanted us to understand how each of our systems would affect earth. This involved taking into account the infrastructure, electricity, and man-power we might be using for a system such as this and it gave us a much deeper understanding of how analysing this could help us make the system more sustainable. This activity involved a visiting team posting questions on resource consumption, forcing us to think of ways we could automate certain tasks. In particular, one of the stages in the system involved the use of people collecting and transporting algae to a processing unit which has since been automated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other activity that was of great use to our team was Technology deep dives. This activity introduced us to a few resources around emerging technology and identifying development cycles using the Gartner hype cycle. This activity also involved prompts about identifying any emerging (or Deep tech from CERN) that the system could make use of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These resources and prompts provided the team with enough motivation to think about how technology might evolve in the next 25 years, considering evolution over the last 25 years. In addition, the team also made use of Gartner's hype cycle to predict feasibility upon identifying potential use cases from the Tech Trends report. With research in each of these fields inspiring us, we started working on sketches of how the system and its components (particularly the sensors) might look and work. After many iterations of white boarding and sketching, we started to form an idea on how the system would operate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, something our team is worried about is, despite there being a significant amount of research on each of these technologies independently, none of them have been field tested extensively enough for us to be able to predict either requirements or outputs with some of them.
                </p>

                    NEXUS: Rethinking, Refining, and Reimagining
                </p>
                <p>
                    This month, our team was introduced to a range of new concepts –  not just from the NYC Design Factory but also from various external design factories. Each session pushed us further, forcing us to think critically about the real-world impact of our ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest eye-openers was Planet-Centric Design – a framework that made us evaluate how our system interacts with Earth's resources. The teaching team challenged us to consider infrastructure, electricity, and manpower usage, helping us see the bigger picture. A visiting team posed tough questions about resource consumption, leading us to rethink manual tasks in our system. A prime example? Originally, algae collection and transport required human effort, but thanks to this exercise, we’ve now automated that process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This activity also made us step back and reflect: Even though our idea is designed for a 2050 Human Inc. future scenario – a world where technological progress thrives but environmental conditions worsen – we asked ourselves: Shouldn’t we be striving for a better future instead of just adapting to a deteriorating one? This reinforced our belief that innovation should benefit the planet, people, and culture, not just solve problems within a compromised world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Diving into Deep Tech
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another major breakthrough came from our Technology Deep Dives. We explored emerging technologies, dissected the Gartner Hype Cycle, and looked at potential applications for Deep Tech from CERN. These sessions helped us think beyond what’s possible today and speculate on how technology might evolve over the next 25 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the Gartner Hype Cycle, we examined feasibility, pinpointing which tech trends could realistically become game-changers. This activity prompted us to go beyond just brainstorming futuristic concepts – it encouraged us to think strategically about what could be built, tested, and implemented over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an Idea to a Holistic System
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fueled by research and speculative thinking, we moved into the next phase – sketching and prototyping. Whiteboarding sessions became second nature as we iterated on how our system (especially its sensors) should function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But one challenge remains: Even though the technologies we’re exploring are well-researched, they haven’t been extensively field-tested together. That uncertainty forced us to rethink our approach – instead of focusing on a single, isolated idea, why not create a holistic system that integrates multiple technologies?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than just designing one independent concept, we’re now looking at how current technology, futuristic innovation, and creative problem-solving can come together into something more exciting, scalable, and impactful. Regardless of what we build, one thing remains certain: We must design with care, appreciation, and responsibility – leveraging what we have today to create a future that benefits both the planet and humankind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What’s Next?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to explore, experiment, and push boundaries. The road ahead won’t be easy, but challenges fuel creativity, and we’re ready to embrace them. Stay tuned – there’s more to come! 🚀
